## How to tweek this project for your own use

You are free to use and make changes is my code. I would recommend you to clone and rename this project and use it for your own purpose. Certain points need to be kept in mind while you make any changes.
1. Even though CSS file has been structured using comments, HTML file is structured but lacks comments and JS file is just coarse.
2. Folder structuring is not done properly as this was my earliest of projects and I was ignorant.
3. Image resources cannot be accessed as they are stored as ftp. You will find image url and not any path.
